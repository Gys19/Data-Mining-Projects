HW1 - The dataset “housetype.data” represents an extract from a commercial marketing database created from questionnaires filled out by shopping mall customers in the San Francisco Bay area.

attributeHist function in HW1 files takes the name of an attribute, such as “age", finds the corresponding column in the table, and produces the histogram. By default, it puts the long attribute name into the title and on the horizontal axis. If the attribute contains “missing values” (represented as NA in the data), a message with the missing count is printed.
